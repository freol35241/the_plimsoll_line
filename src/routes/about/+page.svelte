	<h2>The Mark on the Hull</h2>

	<p>
		In the 1860s and 1870s, unseaworthy and overloaded ships were a routine cause of death
		among British merchant sailors. Shipowners, many of them members of Parliament,
		profited from the practice — vessels were heavily insured, and losses at sea were
		simply a cost of business. The sailors who drowned had no such safety net.
	</p>

	<p>
		Samuel Plimsoll, a coal merchant turned MP, spent years compiling data on ship losses
		and campaigning for reform. He was ridiculed, sued, and nearly expelled from
		Parliament. But public outrage eventually proved impossible to ignore. The Merchant
		Shipping Act of 1876 made it mandatory to paint a load line on the hull of every
		cargo vessel — the Plimsoll line. If the waterline rose above the mark, the ship
		was overloaded.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Plimsoll line doesn't say "this ship is bad." It just shows where the waterline
		sits relative to the mark. Anyone looking can draw their own conclusion.
	</p>

	<h2>What This Is</h2>

	<p>
		The Plimsoll Line is a research blog that uses public data to tell stories worth
		reflecting over. Each story includes an interactive exploration — a way for
		readers to see the data for themselves and form their own conclusions. The editorial
		stance is revelation, not judgment. The data is the point.
